Unfortunately, when I opened it, I saw that the cleats were used. The cleats had dirt all over it and there was a small tear in front of the part where the left toe would go.  My order number is AF26168156.<br></p><p><br>To resolve the problem, I would like you to credit my account for the amount charged for my cleats; I have already went out and bought a new pair of cleats at my local sporting goods store so sending another would result in me having two pairs of the same cleats.<br></p><p><br>Than you for taking the time to read this letter.  I have been a satisfied customer of your company for many years and this is the first time I have encountered a problem.  If you need to contact me, you can reach me at (555) 555-5555.<br><br><br><br>Sincerely,<br></p><p><br><i>Signature</i></p> ",
